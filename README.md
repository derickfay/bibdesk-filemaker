# bibdesk-filemaker
since PocketBib was abandoned, I built a FileMaker database to take its place

## BibDesk Scripts and Templates
- set up templates in BibDesk for each of the .csv files
- run Export for Filemaker to create the main file for import and files for linked files and URLs in join tables
